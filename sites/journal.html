            <p>Hi Journal! This is actually very weird for me. I made this entire website myself from scratch and one thing I love to do is journal my day, at the end of almost every day. So, what if instead of it being private and on my iPad, I literally tell the entire internet. This goes into my first mindy topic of the night and I think privacy is something we need in our society but if we could reform a society without privacy, I think our lives would be a lot less stressful. What have you got to hide??? NOTHING! <em>Anyways,</em> let me tell you about what went on in my day. Okay well, my day started at 12am. I was cramming for my CSC322 final and everything was clicking and it was going so well. Fast forward five hours later, I finish learning the entire class in a night. Kinda proud of myself. Optional attendance at 9am does not get me up in the morning. Then I slept until 10:30 and took my final at 11. It went really well. I swear to goodness I did not miss a single question. Really happy about my performance. Then, I went home and went back to sleep. I woke up later for work and worked until 4:30. Then I went home and sat on my butt for who knows how long and then started working on my website. Now the fourth wall is broken, but who really cares. Thanks for reading.</p>
